# TODO: Add instructions to build, test & deploy Perfkit.

Explorer uses Karma tests to unit test Angular functionality.
To run the local Karma server for debugging, run from the /explorer folder:

## ADD INSTRUCTIONS HERE FOR OPEN-SOURCE TEST EXECUTION ##

To deploy the Perfkit Explorer application:

## ADD INSTRUCTIONS HERE FOR OPEN-SOURCE DEPLOYMENT ##

By default the application will be deployed to a build/version specific to your
client.  For example, with the following values:
  version: 15
  application: MYDASHKIT

  http://15-dot-MYDASHKIT.appspot.com

To deploy/publish a "public" version (to test or prod), take the following
steps:
1. In app.yaml, explicitly set the appropriate "public" version (ie: 3).
   note: It should be set to 'auto' by default.
2. Deploy the application via the steps noted above.
3. Smoke-test the version at the version-specific Url:
   https://15-dot-MYDASHKIT.appspot.com
3. Navigate to the GAE console, ie:
   https://appengine.google.com/deployment?&app_id=MYDASHKIT
4. Click the radio button for the "public" version.
5. Click the "Make Default" button.
6. Delete any old versions from your client that have been created.
