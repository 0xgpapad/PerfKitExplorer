PerfKit Explore Installation Guide
==================================
PerfKit is a service & web front end for composing queries and dashboards,
and sharing the results.

Note the installation instructions below are based on using a Google Cloud
Platform Compute instance, using the Debian Backports image. Instructions for
platform installation may vary depending on your operating system and patch
levels.

Set up your workstation
==========================
1. Install the Python 2.7 SDK.
   sudo apt-get install python2.7
2. Install the Java 7 SDK.
   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk
3. Install Git
   Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install git
4. Install the Google Cloud SDK, https://developers.google.com/cloud/sdk/.
   curl https://sdk.cloud.google.com | bash
   * note: Choose "Python & PHP" from the languages options.
   * note: Restart your shell after installing gcloud to initialize the relevant paths.
5. Authorize your workstation to connect to Google Cloud resources:
   gcloud auth login
6. Create a root folder for your source code (ie: ~/projects) and navigate to it.
7. Download the Closure Tools.
   git clone https://github.com/google/closure-library
   a. Modify your environment (~/.bashrc) so that closurelib is an alias/shortcut
      to the extracted/installed path to closure-library. Example:
      closurelib=~/projects/closure-library
      export closurelib
8. Create a GitHub account at http://www.github.com
   a. Generate and register an SSH key based on GitHub Instructions.
   https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys
9. Initialize a git workspace.
   git clone git@github.com:GoogleCloudPlatform/PerfKitExplorer.git
   If you have connected and authenticated correctly, the source code for
   PerfKit Explorer will download.
   Your projects folder will contain:
   (projects)
     PerfKitExplorer
       bin
       client
       ...
       compile.sh
       app.yaml

Create the App Engine project
=============================
1. Create a Google Cloud project at https://console.developers.google.com/project.
2. Under the API's tab, enable the BigQuery service.

Create the BigQuery repository
==============================
1. Create a Google Cloud project, or user the same one you used for the App
   Engine project.
2. Enable billing for your Cloud Project (available from links on the left-hand side)
   https://console.developers.google.com/project/apps~MYPROJECT/settings
3. Create a dataset (ex: samples_mart):
   bq mk --project=MYPROJECT samples_mart
4. Change folders to the sample data folder:
   pushd ~/projects/PerfKitExplorer/data/samples_mart
5. Upload the sample data to a new table in your dataset (ex: results):
   bq load --project=MYPROJECT --source_format=NEWLINE_DELIMITED_JSON samples_mart.results ./sample_results.json
   popd
6. Add the service account from your App Engine project as an authorized user of
   your BigQuery project.

Compile and Deploy PerfKit
1. Move to the PerfKitExplorer directory:
   cd ~/projects/PerfKitExplorer
2. Modify the app.yaml file so that the application and version tags are
   appropriate. For example:
   application: perfkit-explorer-demo
   version: beta
3. Modify the config/data_source_config.json so that the production tags are
   appropriate for the repository you created in the previous step. For example:
   project_id: 123456789
   project_name: perfkit-samples
   samples-mart: perfkit-samples.samples_mart
   analytics-key: UA-12345
4. Compile the application.
   bash compile.sh
5. You will now find a ~/projects/PerfKitExplorer/deploy folder. Navigate to it.
6. Deploy PerfKit Explorer to App Engine.
   appcfg.py --oauth2 update .
7. By default the application will be deployed to a build/version specific to
   your client. For example, with the following values:
     version: 15
     application: MYPERFKIT
